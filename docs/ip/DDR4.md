## Overview

DDR4 -- INDEPENDENT design IP #2/20. Architecture thesis: the classic 4-bank open-page controller, in-order single engine. Banks indexed by {ch, haddr[10:9]}; per-bank open-row with miss-detect (auto PRE+ACT); all-bank refresh; AL=0; fixed BL. This is the family baseline every other IP differentiates from. Self-contained. External contract: identical to DDR (legacy) -- see DDR_top header.

ck_t, ck_c, cke, addr, ras_n, cas_n, we_n, dq and dqs are the DRAM pins and trace_valid, trace_cmd and trace_addr the command trace (one clock before each command on the pins); they pass through unchanged.
Address map and behaviour of the core: 4-bank open-page controller (banks = haddr[10:9], row = haddr[31:18], storage = 256 columns).
The core's own verification (pin-level checker, 100% coverage) is tb/cov/DDR4_sva.sv with tb/DDR4_tb.sv; this wrapper test drives the core only through the registers.

## APB wrapper

`DDR4_apb` is an APB4 slave (AMBA APB protocol v2.0): zero wait states, 32-bit data, 12-bit byte address, PSTRB byte lanes on every writable register, PSLVERR on an unmapped or misaligned address (reads then return 0, writes are dropped). Writes to read-only registers are ignored without an error. The core runs on PCLK and PRESETN. `irq` is level-high: `|(IRQ_STATUS & IRQ_ENABLE)`.

Pass-through pins: `ck_t`, `ck_c`, `addr`, `ras_n`, `cas_n`, `we_n`, `dq`, `dqs`, `cke`, `trace_valid`, `trace_cmd`, `trace_addr`.

### Register map

| Offset | Name | Access | Reset | Description |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| 0x000 | ID | RO | 0x6D020200 | IP identification: code, major and minor version |
| 0x004 | IRQ_STATUS | W1C | 0x00000000 | Sticky interrupt bits, write 1 to clear |
| 0x008 | IRQ_ENABLE | RW | 0x00000000 | Interrupt enables; irq = \|(IRQ_STATUS & IRQ_ENABLE) |
| 0x00C | FLAGS | RO | 0x00000000 | Stream holding-register state |
| 0x010 | SCRATCH | RW | 0x00000000 | Scratch register, no effect on the core |
| 0x014 | CMD0 | RW | 0x00000000 | Host command; writing CMD2 sends it (the core takes it when it is idle and no refresh is due) |
| 0x018 | CMD1 | RW | 0x00000000 | Host command; writing CMD2 sends it (the core takes it when it is idle and no refresh is due) |
| 0x01C | CMD2 | RW | 0x00000000 | Host command; writing CMD2 sends it (the core takes it when it is idle and no refresh is due) |
| 0x020 | RDATA | RO | core | Read data |

Unlisted bits read 0 and ignore writes. Reset "core": the register reads the core's outputs directly, so after reset it shows the core's own reset state. WO (pulse) registers read 0. Offsets from 0x024 up to 0xFFC are unmapped (PSLVERR).

### Fields

| Register | Bits | Field | Access | Reset | Description |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| ID | 31:16 | CODE | RO | 0x6D02 | IP code |
| ID | 15:8 | MAJOR | RO | 0x02 | major version |
| ID | 7:0 | MINOR | RO | 0x00 | minor version |
| IRQ_STATUS | 2:0 | one bit per interrupt | W1C | 0x0 | see Interrupts |
| IRQ_ENABLE | 2:0 | one bit per interrupt | RW | 0x0 | 1 enables the IRQ_STATUS bit onto `irq` |
| FLAGS | 0 | one bit per stream flag | RO | 0x0 | see FLAGS |
| SCRATCH | 31:0 | SCRATCH | RW | 0x00000000 | free for software |
| CMD0 | 2:0 | `hcmd` | RW | 0x0 | 1 ACT, 2 RD, 3 WR, 4 PRE; other codes are no-ops |
| CMD1 | 31:0 | `haddr` | RW | 0x0 | host address (bank, row and column fields below) |
| CMD2 | 15:0 | `hwdata` | RW | 0x0 | word to write (WR) |
| RDATA | 15:0 | `hrdata` | RO | core | word of the last RD, valid once RD_DONE is set |

### Interrupts (IRQ_STATUS, IRQ_ENABLE)

A bit is set while its source is active, stays set until written with 1, and a set in the same clock as the clear wins.

| Bit | Name | Set when |
|---|---|---|
| 0 | RD_DONE | a RD finished; RDATA holds its word |
| 1 | CMD_DONE | CMD beat accepted by the core |
| 2 | CMD_OVF | write to CMD while full (dropped) |

### FLAGS

| Bit | Name | Meaning |
|---|---|---|
| 0 | CMD_FULL | CMD holds a beat the core has not taken |

### Streams

* **CMD** feeds `hcmd`, `haddr`, `hwdata`/`hvalid`. Writing CMD2 commits the beat: FLAGS.CMD_FULL is set and `hvalid` stays high until the core's `hready`; then CMD_DONE is set. A write while full is dropped and sets CMD_OVF.

## Programming sequence

1. Release PRESETN. Read ID (0x000) and check it is 0x6D020200.
2. Write 0x7 to IRQ_STATUS (0x004) to clear any stale bits.
3. Write IRQ_ENABLE (0x008) with the interrupts to use (bit order as in the Interrupts table; 0x7 enables all).
4. To send on CMD: wait until FLAGS.CMD_FULL (bit 0) is 0, or for IRQ CMD_DONE, then write CMD0 (0x014) then CMD1 (0x018) then CMD2 (0x01C). The last write commits the beat. CMD_OVF means a write came while the register was full and was dropped.
5. Read RDATA (0x020) for the core's live `hrdata`; it needs no clearing.
6. On `irq`: read IRQ_STATUS, handle every bit that is set and enabled, then write those bits back to IRQ_STATUS to clear them. A source that is still active sets its bit again.
